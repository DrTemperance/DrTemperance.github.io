				I plan to live in Seattle, Washington, by the advent of my third decade.<br>
				I love the rain and fog/dark, so Seattle would be an excellent setting for my later life.
				I also have always felt a connection to the city.

				I plan to spend 4–12 years of my life in college because I want to get a doctorate and work for a famous
				pharmaceutical company as their lead researcher in their marine pharmacology department. I look forward
				to writing a dissertation on the effects of prescribing medication to children as an easy way out rather
				than diagnosing and fixing the problem as a whole; 90% of the time, the problem can't be fixed, and
				instead of throwing drugs at it, we should try to integrate everyone's basic educational needs rather
				than isolate everyone. The leading cause of drug use later in life is partly from the early prescription
				of CNS stimulants to ages under 10yrs
				<i>(They can prescribe stimulants to children as young as 4 years old)</i>
				Another significant contributing factor is the social/emotional impact of telling a child that they are
				wrong and different from others, making them believe that they are a problem, leading to further social
				isolation and anxiety, which, Oh Look At That! Prescribe more drugs to "fix" their anxiety.<br>
				<i>(Which could have been prevented early on) </i><br><i>
				Oh, look, you got me started; this will be an easy paper for me.</i></p>
